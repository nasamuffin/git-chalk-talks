# How to Facilitate

The session facilitator is responsible for making sure the chalk talk
session happens, on time, with minimal technical issues, and with
healthy community interactions. If you're interested in becoming a session
facilitator, reach out to git@vger.kernel.org.

## Session Rundown

1. Join the Jitsi channel ahead of time, so you will have moderator
privileges in that channel. (First one in "owns" the channel.)

2. Open up OBS, check that everything (audio, screenshare, etc) is working

3. Open up the
[Twitch dashboard](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/gitontwitch), check that
the stream description and tags are set up

4. At the scheduled start time, start the Twitch stream

5. Help to choose a speaker and topic; check the
[issue list](https://github.com/nasamuffin/git-chalk-talks/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atalk-topic)
for inspiration.

6. If necessary during the talk, perform moderator activities (banning
bots, etc) and call out questions from the Twitch chat as necessary.

7. At the end of the scheduled time, remember to stop the Twitch stream
before you go back to whatever you were doing on your computer!

## First Time Setup

* Familiarize yourself with OBS. Practice capturing the audio from the
Jitsi call as well as your own microphone audio, and the video from a
window (usually whatever virtual chalkboard someone is using).

* Make a Twitch account if you don't have one already, and familiarize
yourself with the Creator Dashboard. You'll be using the same kind of
dashboard to monitor the stream chat and quality during the talk.

* Get credentials and permissions from nasamuffin or another facilitator.
Your Twitch account will need to be added with "Editor" and "Moderator"
roles, and will also need to be invited to stream to the GitOnTwitch
account.
